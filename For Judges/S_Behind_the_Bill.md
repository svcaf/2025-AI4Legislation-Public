## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria                   | Weight | Score (1â€“5) | Comments |
|----------------------------|--------|-------------|----------|
| Innovation & Creativity    | 25%    | 4           | Ongoing learning based on articles chosen, specialized terminology explanations, conversational agents all very creative use of AI |
| Impact & Relevance         | 25%    | 4           | Helps users engage and understand legislation, attractive interface will help with engagement |
| Technical Excellence       | 20%    | 3           | In the browser a little slow and clunky to use. The simulate legislative impact feature is very exciting but as currently implemented fairly suspect. Similar feedback for the chat feature. |
| Usability & Accessibility  | 15%    | 4           | Well thought out layout, simple, I was able to easily find and use all of the promised features. |
| Ethics & Fairness          | 15%    | 3           | Many of the news sources were highly partisan or biased, which should be accounted for. Chat feature gave such bland answers it is unlikely to go off the rails as currently implemented |

**Total Score (Weighted Sum):** 3.65 / 5.00

## Additional Comments

Some really great ideas in here. With some testing and user feedback this could really grow into something interesting. Biggest issue for the browser implementation was there was no way (I could figure out) to scroll down and see the additional content below the fold.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria                   | Weight | Score (1â€“5) | Comments |
|----------------------------|--------|-------------|----------|
| Innovation & Creativity    | 25%    | 3           | Predicting if a bill will pass is an important but not groundbreaking idea. The threshold idea is excellent |
| Impact & Relevance         | 25%    | 4           | Very relevant, especially for journalists. Slightly misunderstands how Congress works and how and when other stakeholders should engage. |
| Technical Excellence       | 20%    | 5           | Very solid technically, I appreciate the detail provided in the video about the factors going into the prediction, nice mixture of approaches to get a balanced prediction. |
| Usability & Accessibility  | 15%    | 5           | Nice job with the confidence intervals and graphs and overall transparency around how trustworthy the predictions are. |
| Ethics & Fairness          | 15%    | 5           | No worries about LLM safeguards here, and transparency is baked in throughout. Strategic Recommendations should probably address both supporting and opposing the bill. |

**Total Score (Weighted Sum):** 4.25 / 5.00

## Additional Comments

The problems described are real. The threshold idea for analysis is a solid approach. I really like the future vision and would be excited to see further development.

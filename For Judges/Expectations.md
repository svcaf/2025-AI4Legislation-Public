# AI4Legislation 2025 Judge Expectations

### Welcome Judges!
Thank you for contributing your expertise to AI4Legislation 2025. Your role is crucial in ensuring a fair, thorough, and insightful evaluation of projects submitted by participants. Below are the official judging criteria and expectations for scoring.

Please find the scoring template [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QDL544tfsXJZylPYG_pfXJerEY_9C2tYhwNZU4XV2dQ/edit?usp=sharing) and make a copy for your own use. Your evaluation for each team must be shared or emailed to cynthia@svcaf.org by the end of the judging period (TBD).

## Evaluation Criteria
Each project will be assesed based on five key criteria, weighted as follows:
### [25%] Innovation & Creativity
* Does the project introduce a novel approach or solution to a legislative/civic problem?
* How creative is the use of AI in addressing the identified issue?
### [25%] Impact & Relevance
* How well does the project address real-world challenges in legislation, policy analysis, or civic engagement?
* Could the solution be realistically implemented or scaled for broader societal benefit?
### [20%] Technical Excellence
* Is the AI model, algorithm, or system well-designed, efficient, and technically sound?
* Does the project demonstrate a solid understanding of AI and relevant technologies?
### [15%] Usability & Accessibility
* Is the project easy to use and accessible to the intended audience?
* Does it provide a clear and user-friendly interface or experience?
### [15%] Ethical Considerations and Fairness
* Does the project consider issues of fairness, bias, and transparency in AI decision-making?
* Are there safeguards to prevent misues or unintended consequences?

## Scoring & Feedback
Each criterion should be scored on a scale of 1-10, where 1 represents criteria is not met and 10 represents exceeds criteria expectations. Constructive feedback is highly encouraged: participants benefit from clear insights into their projectâ€™s strengths and areas for improvement.

## Final Ranking
Each project's total score will be calculated based on the weighted Evaluation Criteria. Judges will discuss any major discrepancies (e.g. Judges A & B scored Project X with a 3 on Ethical Considerations, whereas Judges C & D scored it at a 9.) in order to ensure fairness and consistency in rankings. Tiebreakers and other special circumstances will be handled by the panel collectively.

## Judging Ethics
Please evaluate projects objectively and impartially:
* Disclose any potential conflicts of interest before reviewing a project.
* Maintain confidentiality regarding submissions and deliberations.

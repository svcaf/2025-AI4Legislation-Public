## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria                   | Weight | Score (1–5) | Comments |
|----------------------------|--------|-------------|----------|
| Innovation & Creativity    | 25%    | 3           | Comparing bills to find differences is a straightforward idea, the addition of stakeholder analysis and impact forecast is a nice extension of the analysis |
| Impact & Relevance         | 25%    | 5           | Such an important task, and getting it right could be of huge use to citizens, activists, lobbyists, staffers, journalists, and policymakers in general |
| Technical Excellence       | 20%    | 3           | Summary of text changes worked quite well (I did CA AB392) I like the idea of the graphics but they aren’t actually very informative, Impact forecast is a thoughtful inclusion but also a bit of a reach |
| Usability & Accessibility  | 15%    | 5           | Very obvious how to get started and was easy for me to upload documents and get results, and the results were well presented |
| Ethics & Fairness          | 15%    | 3           | Getting an unbiased look at a bill is an enormous task, AI generally wants to support an idea, and in my experience will say two diametrically opposed bills both have only positive impacts. AI almost always overlooks opportunity costs of what else could be done with the money being spent. And etc. This analysis is really hard to pull of well. |

**Total Score (Weighted Sum):** 3.80 / 5.00

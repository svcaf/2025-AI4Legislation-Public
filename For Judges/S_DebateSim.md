## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria                   | Weight | Score (1–5) | Comments |
|----------------------------|--------|-------------|----------|
| Innovation & Creativity    | 25%    | 5           | The idea of understanding a bill via debate is really clever and actually pretty fun, having the AI debate itself is a nice feature too. |
| Impact & Relevance         | 25%    | 5           | Seeing arguments for and against a bill, or analyzing the effectiveness of different arguments is super relevant in today’s environment. Encouraging logical arguments is a breath of fresh air! |
| Technical Excellence       | 20%    | 5           | The upload feature worked well, searching for bills not so much. The execution of the debate AI appears flawless |
| Usability & Accessibility  | 15%    | 4           | I really enjoyed playing with the tool as it, it was easy to navigate, and very polished looking overall. Searching for bills wasn’t very effective. |
| Ethics & Fairness          | 15%    | 5           | Based on the slide presentation ethics were considered but wow, what a minefield. I used HR 1229 to see if I could get inappropriate and it did surprisingly well. |

**Total Score (Weighted Sum):** 4.85 / 5.00

## Additional Comments

Reading through the debate, and doing my own debate, is an amazingly good way to engage with a bill. Fantastic presentation of the product and exciting future roadmap. Can’t wait to see the Bias Detector! I would love to see the tool tackle state legislation too, which arguably matters more as there are more bills and way more bills that pass.

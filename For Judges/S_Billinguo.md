## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria                   | Weight | Score (1â€“5) | Comments |
|----------------------------|--------|-------------|----------|
| Innovation & Creativity    | 25%    | 3           | Clearly building on common ideas (which is right in the name) but nice twist to gamify learning legislative concepts and terms |
| Impact & Relevance         | 25%    | 4           | As it sits today probably really a 3, but with localization could really help people learn about how their state works vs how Congress works which would be very valuable |
| Technical Excellence       | 20%    | 4           | AI works nicely in the background providing content quickly and appropriately |
| Usability & Accessibility  | 15%    | 5           | What is implemented looks great, works flawlessly, benefits from focused MVP scope |
| Ethics & Fairness          | 15%    | 3           | Manual review is fine for an MVP but a lot more thought needs to be given about how to keep some potentially sensitive topics non-partisan but still accurate and the example situations reasonable |

**Total Score (Weighted Sum):** 3.75 / 5.00

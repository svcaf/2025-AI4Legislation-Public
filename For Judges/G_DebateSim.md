## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria                   | Weight | Score (1â€“5) | Comments |
|----------------------------|--------|-------------|----------|
| Innovation & Creativity    | 25%    | 3.5         | DebateSim offers a creative simulation of legislative debate, leveraging AI to model both debater and judge roles. The approach is novel for civic education, though the core idea aligns with existing debate simulators. The use of chains for debater and judge logic is a thoughtful design, but further unique AI-driven features could enhance creativity. |
| Impact & Relevance         | 25%    | 4.0         | The project addresses real-world needs in civic education and legislative understanding. Its potential for classroom or public use is strong, especially with the ability to simulate realistic debates and provide feedback. Scalability is feasible given the modular backend/frontend structure. |
| Technical Excellence       | 20%    | 4.0         | The codebase demonstrates solid technical skills: modular Python backend, React frontend, and integration with speech-to-text and AI chains. The use of Gradio and Firebase shows good understanding of modern tools. Some areas (e.g., error handling, code comments) could be improved for robustness. |
| Usability & Accessibility  | 15%    | 3.5         | The UI is user-friendly and visually appealing, with clear navigation and features like file upload and voice input. Accessibility could be further improved (e.g., more ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, clearer error messages). |
| Ethics & Fairness          | 15%    | 3.5         | The project considers fairness in debate judging and transparency in AI decisions. However, more explicit safeguards against bias and clearer documentation of AI decision logic would strengthen this area. |

**Total Score (Weighted Sum):** 3.73 / 5.00

## Additional Comments

- Impressive integration of AI and debate simulation for civic learning.
- Consider adding more transparency around AI decision-making and bias mitigation.
- Further accessibility improvements would broaden the audience.

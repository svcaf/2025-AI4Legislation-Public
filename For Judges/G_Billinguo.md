## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria                   | Weight | Score (1â€“5) | Comments |
|----------------------------|--------|-------------|----------|
| Innovation & Creativity    | 25%    | 3.5         | The project presents a creative approach to legislative education, using interactive course modules and a modern UI. The use of AI appears limited to project generation, but the structure is thoughtfully designed for extensibility. |
| Impact & Relevance         | 25%    | 3.5         | Billingo addresses civic education by breaking down legislative processes into accessible lessons. The modular data structure allows for future expansion and adaptation to different curricula. |
| Technical Excellence       | 20%    | 2.5         | The codebase is clean and uses modern React (with TypeScript and Vite). However, there is no evidence of custom AI models or advanced algorithms; most logic is standard for a learning platform. |
| Usability & Accessibility  | 15%    | 3.5         | The UI components are well-organized, and the app structure supports a user-friendly experience. Accessibility features are not explicitly detailed, but the code is modular and maintainable. |
| Ethics & Fairness          | 15%    | 2.5         | The project mentions AI was only used to generate the project. There are no explicit features addressing fairness, bias, or transparency, but the educational focus reduces risk of harm. |

**Total Score (Weighted Sum):** 3.15 / 5.00

## Additional Comments

The project is a solid foundation for civic education, with clear potential for further development. Consider integrating more AI-driven features (e.g., personalized learning, content recommendations) and explicit accessibility/ethical safeguards in future iterations.

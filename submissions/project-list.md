## Project \#2 Congressional Bill Tracker

\- Project Name: Congressional Bill Tracker

\- Category: Bill Analysis

\- Team Name: Oliver Fan (Individual Submission)

\- Team Members: Oliver Fan

\- GitHub Repository: [https://github.com/oliversoctopus/predictive-bill-tracker-dashboard](https://github.com/oliversoctopus/predictive-bill-tracker-dashboard)

\- Commit Hash for Submission: 6515f1f (full hash: 6515f1fc3a34b66545ce18631f6cc4d064deea66)

\- YouTube Demo Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLsZL\_xDgDU\&ab\_channel=OliverFan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLsZL_xDgDU&ab_channel=OliverFan)

\- Live Demo Website : https://predictivebilltracker.streamlit.app/

1\. Project Code & Implementation  
   • The GitHub repository includes all source code, trained models, and a comprehensive README.md with installation/usage instructions.  
   • A fully functional Streamlit dashboard (src/app.py) demonstrates real-time bill analysis capabilities.  
   • Data collection and model training notebooks are included in the data/ and models/ directories.

2\. Datasets  
   • The project utilizes publicly available data from the Congress.gov API, analyzing 16,500+ bills from the 118th Congress (2023-2024).  
   • Data preprocessing pipelines handle bill metadata, legislative actions, cosponsors, and committee assignments.  
   • Ethical considerations include transparent prediction uncertainty and avoiding partisan bias.

3\. AI Models  
   • Two-phase ensemble ML system combining Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression.  
   • Time-aware approach with three specialized models based on bill age (New/Early/Progressive).  
   • Achieves 78-82% ROC-AUC with calibrated probability outputs.  
   • Model files and training methodology fully documented in docs/model\_architecture.md.

4\. Technical Documentation  
   • Project Report (docs/project\_report.md)  
   • Data Documentation (docs/data.md)  
   • Model Architecture (docs/model\_architecture.md)  
   • Usage Guide (docs/app\_usage.md)  
   • Ethical Considerations (docs/ethics.md)

5\. Video Demonstration  
   • The 7-minute demo video showcases live bill analysis, explains the two-phase prediction system, and demonstrates real-world impact.

6\. Presentation Slides  
   • A 10-slide presentation deck is included in the repository (docs/presentation.pdf) and attached. [link](https://github.com/svcaf/2025-AI4Legislation-Public/blob/abeee911afc86826623f108f1ce2dd9b1332a846/submissions/Project%202%20Congressional%20Bill%20Tracker/Presentation%20-%20AI-Powered%20Bill%20Tracker%20Predicting%20Legislative%20Success.pdf)
    
    
7\. License & Attribution  
   • The project is released under the MIT License with Commons Clause.  
   • All data sources (Congress.gov API) and libraries are properly attributed in the documentation (docs/attributions.md).

Key Innovation Highlights  
\- Time-aware modeling that adapts predictions as bills age  
\- Confidence intervals providing transparent uncertainty quantification  
\- Focus on actionable insights with only 1.7% of bills becoming law  
\- Real-time integration with official congressional data

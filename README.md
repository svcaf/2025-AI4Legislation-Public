## Submission Categories  
Participants may submit projects in one of the following categories:
* **Legislative Tracking**: AI-powered tools to monitor the progress of bills, amendments, and key legislative changes.
Dashboards and visualizations that help the public track government actions.
* **Bill Analysis**:  AI tools that generate easy-to-understand summaries, pros/cons, and potential impacts of legislative texts. NLP-based applications that translate legal jargon into plain language.
* **Civic Action & Advocacy**: AI chatbots or platforms that help users contact their representatives, sign petitions, or organize civic actions.
